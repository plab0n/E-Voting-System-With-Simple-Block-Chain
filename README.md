# E-Voting-System-With-Simple-Block-Chain
I had participated in Falguni Code Sprint - 2019. There I had worked with a project called E-Voting System. It was a team project. I had implemented the Block Chain for the system from scratch by using Python.
This repository doesn't contain the whole project. It contains only the work I have done for this project.
